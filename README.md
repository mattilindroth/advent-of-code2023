Advent of code - 2023 with Golang

# What is this
Avent of code is an advent calendar for coders. You can find it here: https://adventofcode.com/2023

This is my attempt to learn Golang while doing these exercises. I don't meant to solve all the problems but rather learn the language while doing these exercises.
